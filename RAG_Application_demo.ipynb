Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, RNNs have connections that form loops, allowing them to maintain a hidden state that can be used to process input data over time. This makes RNNs particularly effective for tasks such as language processing, speech recognition, and time series prediction. In TensorFlow, RNNs can be implemented using various techniques, such as vanilla RNNs, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and gated recurrent units (GRUs).\n"
